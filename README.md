Smart Water Management System This system will replace our traditional manual water distribution system with smart integrated system. Our proposed system removes all drawbacks from traditional water supply. It’s save water, reduce manpower, reduce cost ect.

Abstract— Current ancient water distribution system needs additional personnel and should cause wastage of water, as a result of the distribution isn't pre-intimated or pre-planned. This manual distribution of water by gap and shutting valves on roads might cause accidents and is additional time intense. Because it needs additional personnel, it's conjointly not price effective. Conjointly ancient system failed to maintain any record associated with distribution time or quantity of water to be distributed.
To develop a sensible integrated system for water distribution. The distribution are going to be prescheduled and pre-intimated to the voters over the net. This method makes use of electronic valves (Solenoid valve) rather than manual valves. The management of the valves are going to be controlled through Mobile App as per schedule and can be notified beforehand to the voters of specific area through the net or SMS in order that the wastage of water may be prevented. However, undetected  leaks, even small  ones, will  lead  to giant  quantities  of  lost  water  since  these  leaks may  exist  for  a  long  time.  Ironically, several little  leaks ar  easier  to find because  they ar  noisier  and  easier  to  hear victimization  hydrophones.

Design of good water distribution system comprises several little systems operating in a very alignment to perform systematic water distribution. The given system works on good hardwares mainly accustomed operate the system in such a way that if any drawback detects then it is solved simply and handily.  Front finish: ahead End we have a tendency to style dynamic web site exploitation HTML, PHP, Bootstrap,JAVA, CSS, JavaScript

1. backside: In Back finish we have a tendency to square measure exploitation MySQL for information, PHP, JavaScript, ARDUINO Board secret writing
2. Input: space Name is that the input.
3. Output: Valve ON/OFF that given space.
4. Success Conditions: Valve can work in step with given command.
5. Failure Conditions: Valve won't work 

In step with given command Firstly the operator can offer command through web-application to webserver then this can transfer to local area network protect. local area network protect have their own informatics Address exploitation this address, web-server can communicate with local area network protect. local area network protect or Wi-Fi protect is connected with microcontroller. at that time microcontroller can pass the command to coil valves. These natural philosophy valves can ON/OFF consequently to operator command that is given to microcontroller.

In this project we are creating a Simple website through website all volves are controlled.
